# WMFPrep
Brain white-matter (WM) functional information have recently been explored using functional magnetic resonance imaging preprocessing (fMRI) during resting-state. WMFPrep is a
MATLAB toolbox, with an easy, flexible and quick manner, for functional preprocessing withinWM. Add WMFPrep directory to MATLAB's path and enter "WMFPrep" in the command window of
MATLAB to enjoy it. 
                                                                                                                                                               
This is a companion to manuscript entitled "Transcriptomic and macroscopic architecture of intersubject functional variabilities in human brain white-matter".

Uniform parcellate: Parcellate the group white-matter mask into 2n regions. The size of the regions was almost equal. The code is obtained from previous study by Zalesky, A., et al., Neuroimage, 2010, 50: 970-983.                                                                                                                                                 
This toolbox works on MATLAB 2014a and higher, including Windows (8, 10 and Server versions), and Linux (Ubuntu and CentOS) in 64-bit versions.
